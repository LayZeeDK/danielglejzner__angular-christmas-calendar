We express our gratitude to [Johnny Fekete](https://twitter.com/FullStackMaker) for his outstanding contributions to the development of the 'CSS Christmas Calendar,' serving as the inspiration for the creation of the 'Angular Christmas Calendar.'

[CSS Christmas Calendar](https://github.com/johnnyfekete/CSSChristmasCalendar) is an experiment with 24 festive CSS-art hidden under each day in the calendar.

Project we created isCommunity-driven summary
of #Angular events in 2024.

24 Guests.
24 Windows.
Each opening over 24 days.

Starting December 1st 2024.

A new window opens every day.
Leading up to Christmas Eve.

Each guest will share their personal insights on Angular as seen in 2024.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.2.

## Package Manager `pnpm`

Enable `pnpm` using Node.js's `corepack`:

```sh
corepack enable
```

```sh
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

## Install packages

```sh
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
