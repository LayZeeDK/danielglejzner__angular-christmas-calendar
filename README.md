Project we created isCommunity-driven summary
of #Angular events in 2024.

24 Guests.
24 Windows.
Each opening over 24 days.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.0.

## Package Manager `pnpm`

Enable `pnpm` using Node.js's `corepack`:

```sh
corepack enable
```

```sh
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

## Install packages

```sh
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
